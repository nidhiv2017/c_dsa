QUESTION 1: What is a struct? (A user-defined composite data type to group related variables)

ANSWERS: Struct (short for structure) is a user-defined composite data type that allows you to group 
related variables under a single name. It's like creating a custom data blueprint that holds 
various pieces of information together.

Here are some key characteristics of structs:

Grouping variables: A struct combines variables of potentially different data types 
(like integers, strings, floats) into a single unit. This makes it easier to manage and work 
with related data sets.

User-defined name: You assign a name to the struct, which acts as a template for creating 
instances (variables) of that struct type.

Improved code organization: By grouping related data, structs promote better code organization 
and readability. You can easily identify and access relevant data members within the struct.
Efficient data handling: Structs are efficient for handling data that naturally belongs together,
like representing a person (name, age, address) or a product (name, price, quantity).

Here's an example of a struct in C to represent a book:

C
struct Book {
  char title[50];
  char author[50];
  int numPages;
  float price;
};

In this example:

struct Book defines the struct type named Book.
The curly braces {} enclose the member variables:
title: Character array to store the book's title (up to 50 characters).
author: Character array to store the book's author (up to 50 characters).
numPages: Integer to store the number of pages in the book.
price: Float to store the book's price.

QUESTION 2: How do you declare and define a struct in C/C++?

ANSWERS: C:

Struct declaration:
Use the struct keyword followed by the chosen struct name and curly braces {}.
Inside the curly braces, define the member variables with their data types.

struct Book {
  char title[50];
  char author[50];
  int numPages;
  float price;
};

Struct definition (not required):
In C, struct definition isn't mandatory. Just the declaration creates the blueprint for the struct.

Key Points:

Struct member variables are accessed using the dot . operator after the struct variable name.
C++ allows member functions within structs to operate on the struct data, but C structs cannot.
Structs provide a powerful mechanism for organizing and managing related data in your C/C++ programs.

****************************************************************************************************

QUESTION 3: How do you access members (variables) of a struct?

In C and C++, you access members (variables) of a struct using the dot operator (.) after the
struct variable name. Here's how it works:

Struct variable:

Declare a variable of the struct type you defined. This creates an instance of the struct to hold
specific data.
Dot operator (.):

Use the dot operator (.) to access individual member variables within the struct.
struct Book {
  char title[50];
  char author[50];
  int numPages;
  float price;
};

struct Book book1; // Declare a variable 'book1' of type 'Book'

strcpy(book1.title, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy");
strcpy(book1.author, "Douglas Adams");
book1.numPages = 192;
book1.price = 14.99;

// Accessing member variables
printf("Book Title: %s\n", book1.title);
printf("Author: %s\n", book1.author);
printf("Number of Pages: %d\n", book1.numPages);
printf("Price: %.2f\n", book1.price);

Explanation:

We define a struct Book with member variables title, author, numPages, and price.
We declare a variable book1 of type Book.
We use the dot operator (.) with book1 to access and assign values to its member variables:
book1.title to access the title string.
book1.author to access the author string.
book1.numPages to access the number of pages (integer).
book1.price to access the price (float).

Key Points:

The dot operator allows you to interact with the individual data elements stored within the struct.
You can use this approach to access, modify, or retrieve values from the member variables of a struct.
Member variables can be of different data types, providing flexibility in storing diverse data within
a struct.
By effectively using the dot operator, you can manage and manipulate the data stored within structs 
in your C and C++ programs.

****************************************************************************************************

QUESTION 4: Can you create arrays of structs?


ANSWERS: Declare the struct:

Define the struct type as usual, specifying the member variables and their data types.
Array declaration:

Declare an array variable using the struct name followed by square brackets [] and the desired size.
Example (C and C++):

struct Book {
  char title[50];
  char author[50];
  int numPages;
  float price;
};

// Array of 3 structs (books)
struct Book bookCollection[3];
This code creates an array named bookCollection that can hold three elements of type Book. 
Each element in the array is essentially a complete Book struct, allowing you to store information 
for three different books.

Key Points:

Arrays of structs provide a structured way to store collections of similar data.
You can iterate through the array using loops to access and process each struct element.
This approach is useful for scenarios where you need to manage multiple items with the same data 
structure (e.g., a library catalog, student records, etc.).
Remember the limitations of arrays (fixed size), and consider alternatives like dynamic data 
structures (e.g., linked lists) if you need a more flexible collection size.

QUESTION 5: What are the benefits of using structs for data organization?

ANSWERS: Structs offer several advantages for data organization in C and C++:

1. Improved code readability and maintainability:

By grouping related variables under a meaningful name (struct), your code becomes more 
self-documenting. It's easier to understand what data belongs together and how it's used.
This can improve code maintainability, especially in larger projects where you or others 
need to revisit and modify the codebase.

2. Data integrity and type safety:

Structs enforce data integrity by defining the specific data types for each member variable. 
This helps prevent errors where you accidentally assign an incorrect data type to a variable.
By keeping related data together, you reduce the chance of accidentally modifying or using 
unrelated variables with similar names.
3. Reusability:

Once you define a struct, you can create multiple variables of that type throughout your program.
This promotes code reuse and avoids redundancy.
You can even define structs within header files and include them in different source files, 
making them accessible across your entire program.

4. Efficient data passing:

When you pass a struct to a function, you pass the entire set of related data in one go. 
This can be more efficient than passing individual variables, especially for functions that 
operate on multiple pieces of information.
C structs are passed by value (a copy is made), while C++ structs can be passed by reference 
(original struct is accessed), allowing for more flexibility in function arguments.
5. Custom data types:

Structs allow you to create custom data types that represent real-world entities or concepts. 
This makes your code more expressive and easier to understand.
For example, a Book struct can represent the title, author, number of pages, and price of a book,
providing a clear structure for book-related data.

Structs are a fundamental tool for organizing and managing data in C and C++. 
They promote code clarity, data integrity, reusability, and efficient data handling, making them essential for well-structured and maintainable C/C++ programs.
