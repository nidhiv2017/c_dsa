What is an array?

An array is a data structure that consists of a collection of elements, 
each identified by an index or key.
These elements are typically stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access 
and modification. Arrays are commonly used in programming and computer science for organizing and
managing multiple items of the same type.

How do you declare and initialize an array in C/C++?

There are a few ways to declare and initialize arrays in C and C++, both during declaration 
and after:

1. Declaring and initializing together:

This is the most common way, especially for fixed-size arrays. You specify the data type,
array name, and size in square brackets [], followed by an initializer list in curly braces {}.
int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // Array of 5 integers with initial values

2. Declaring size and initializing later:

You can declare the array size first and then initialize the elements individually using loops
or assignment.
int numbers[5];
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;
// ... assign values to other elements


What are the advantages and disadvantages of using arrays?

Advantages:

Efficient random access: Arrays shine when you need to access specific elements quickly. 
Since elements are stored contiguously in memory, you can directly access any element using 
its index, making it a constant time operation. This is ideal for tasks like iterating through
the array or looking up specific values by position.
Simplicity: Arrays are a fundamental data structure with a straightforward concept. 
They are easy to understand and use, especially for beginners.
Cache-friendliness: Due to contiguous memory allocation, processors can often fetch 
multiple elements in one go, improving performance for operations that access nearby elements.
Built-in functions: C and C++ offer various built-in functions for working with arrays, 
like sorting, searching, and copying, simplifying common operations.
Multi-dimensional support: Arrays can be declared with multiple dimensions 
(e.g., 2D for matrices or 3D for volumes), making them versatile for representing complex 
data structures.

Disadvantages:

Fixed size: A major limitation is the fixed size of arrays. Once declared, you cannot resize 
them later. This can be problematic if you don't know the exact data size beforehand or need 
to dynamically add or remove elements.
Memory waste: If the array is not fully utilized, it can lead to wasted memory space. This might 
be a concern for large datasets or memory-constrained environments.
Inefficient insertion/deletion: Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an array 
is a complex operation. It involves shifting other elements to maintain order, which can be 
inefficient for frequent insertions/deletions. Consider alternative data structures like linked 
lists if that's a core requirement.
Out-of-bounds access: Accessing elements outside the declared array bounds can lead to program 
crashes or unexpected behavior. Careful index checking is crucial to prevent these issues.

How can you access elements within an array?

1. Array subscript operator:

The subscript operator [] takes an integer index as input. This index represents the position
 of the element you want to access within the array.

2. Element index:

The index of an array starts from 0 (zero-based indexing). The first element has an index of 0,
the second element has an index of 1, and so on.  It's important to remember that the valid index
range goes from 0 to the array size minus 1.  Trying to access an element with an index outside
this range leads to undefined behavior, which can cause crashes or unexpected results.

3. Accessing elements:

To access an element, simply write the array name followed by the subscript operator [] containing
 the desired index.  This will return the value stored at that specific position in the array.

How can you iterate over all elements in an array?

1. Using a for loop:

This is the traditional and most common approach. Here's how it works:

Loop variable: Declare a loop variable (often i) to iterate through each index position.
Loop condition: Set the loop condition to check if the index (i) is less than the size of the array.
Remember, the valid index range goes from 0 to the array size minus 1.
Increment: Increment the loop variable (i++) after each iteration to move to the next element.

2. Using a range-based for loop (C++11 and later):

C++11 introduced a more concise and modern way to iterate through arrays using a range-based for 
loop. This approach doesn't require explicit index management.

The sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]) trick in the C example calculates the array size at 
runtime. It's generally not recommended in C++ as there are better ways to determine size 
(consider using std::size(numbers) if your compiler supports it).
The range-based for loop is generally preferred in C++ for its simplicity and readability.
Remember that both methods iterate through each element in the array, allowing you to access
and process the data within the loop.
